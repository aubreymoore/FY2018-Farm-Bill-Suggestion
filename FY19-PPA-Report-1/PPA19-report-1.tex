\section{Staffing}

Staff for this project currently comprises of the PI, a post-doc and
a technician. 

\begin{itemize}
	
\item Funding from the Department of Interior, Office of Island Affairs
was used to hire an insect pathologist for a 2 year term. Dr. James
Grasela was recruited and started work at UOG on June 24, 2018.

\item Mr. Chris Cayanan was hired as a technician for this project on DATE.

\end{itemize}

\section{Laboratory Bioassays of OrNV}

The major goal of this project is to find an effective biological
control agent for coconut rhinoceros beetle biotype G (CRB-G). 

Prior to arrival of CRB on Guam during 2007, coconut rhinoceros beetle
infestations of Pacific islands were readily controled by classical
biological control using Oryctes nudivirus (OrNV). Following a lack
of response to release of OrNV on Guam, research showed that the Guam
CRB population is a genetically distinct virus-resistant biotype which
has become known as CRB-G. This biotype is highly invasive and is
causing massive damage to coconut and oil palms in Papua New Guinea
and the Solomon Islands. CRB-G has also invaded Oahu and Rota. Eradication
attempts have been launched on these two islands. 

The current project is part of an informal international collaboration
among Pacific island entomologist working to find solutions for CRB-G
management. The current focus is on testing new OrNV isolates in the
hope of finding on or more that can be used as an effective biological
control agent for CRB-G.

\subsection{Haemocoel Injection Bioassays}

In this series of assays, we tested 4 islates of OrNV which had produced
by an insect cell culture at the AgResearch Laboratory in New Zealand.
Adult beetles were dosed by direct injection into the haemocoel. This
series is a preliminary test for pathogenicity. Insignificant differences
in mortality curves between virus treatment and the other two treatments
(control treatment and heat-inactivated virus) is an indicator of
pathogenicity. Gut tissue samples have been preserved for histology
and molecular analysis. 

The following is a brief summary of results. Details are provided
in the appended technical reports. Results indicate that isolates
DUG42 and MALB are not pathogenic for CRB-G, but isolates PNG and
V23B are pathogenic. Bioassays in which adult beetles are dosed \emph{per
os} are underway and results will be available in a future report.

\subsubsection{OrNV Isolate DUG42}

Origin: Philippines; 2 replicates; 30 beetles in total

No significant differences among mortality cuves. {[}control, heat-inactivated
virus, virus{]}

\subsubsection{OrNV Isolate MALB}

Origin: Malaysia; 2 replicates; 30 beetles in total

No significant differences among mortality curves. {[}control, heat-inactivated
virus, virus{]}

\subsubsection{OrNV Isolate PNG}

Origin: Papua New Guinea; 4 replicates; 71 beetles in total

Mortality curves in 2 significantly different groups: {[}control,
heat-inactivated virus{]}, {[}virus{]}

\subsubsection{OrNV Isolate V23B}

Origin: Solomon Islands; 4 repicates; 66 beetles in total

Mortality curves in 2 significantly different groups: {[}control,
heat-inactivated virus{]}, {[}virus{]}

\section{Environmental Cabinets and CRB Rearing}

Three environmental cabinets which allow control of temperature, relative
humidity, and lighting for insect rearing were procured and installed.
These chambers are set to maintain 30\textdegree{}C, 80\% RH and
12h photoperiod.

After a power outage caused by a typhoon, one of the cabinets malfunctioned.
It heated beyond the setpoint and killed all beetles. To prevent this
problem from recurring, controllers for all three units have been
programmed to send email to project staff whenever a fault is detected.

The project does not currently rear beetles form egg to adult. Because
CRB are so numerous on Guam, it is far more efficient to field collect
prepupae, pupae and adults and rear these to the age required for
bioassays. Adults are fed banana slices.

\section{CRB Damage Survey}
\begin{itemize}
\item A 360 degree digital camera and accessories were purchased.
\item A protocol for roadside CRB damage surveys using digital imagery was
developed and trial runs were made.
\item A workflow for scoring CRB damage from digital imagery is under development.
\end{itemize}

\section{Regional Collaboration}

An informal collaboration, the \textit{CRB-G Action Group}, has been formed among Pacific-based entomologists working on the CRB-G problem. Participants from Guam, Hawaii, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Fiji, Malaysia, Japan and New Zealand have met several times and future meetings are planned (Table \ref{tab:action-group}).  This is an \textit{ad hoc} group which has been organized by Dr. Trevor Jackson and Sean Marshall of AgResearch New Zealand. AgResearch is recognized as a global center for expertise on biological control of CRB. AgResearch scientists have worked on CRB in the south Pacific for several decades and they maintain a library of OrNV isolates in cell culture. The New Zealand government has recently committed several million dollars to aid response to CRB-G in the south Pacific islands.

Although individual institutions working to find a solution to the CRB-G problem on American-affiliated islands in the northern Pacific have secured funding from multiple, short-term grants, attempts to secure funding to support a sustainable well-coordinated regional project have been unsuccessful. We respectfully request SERDP funding to support collaboration and cooperation on progress towards solving the CRB-G problem among partners in the American Pacific in partnership with international colleagues in the south Pacific. If our request is granted the project PI and staff at NCSU would be tasked with organizing quarterly Pacific-wide teleconferences and helping to organize and fund participation from the American Pacific in annual CRB-G Action Group conferences in 2021 through 2024.

\subsection{Participation in Scientific Meetings}

Moore and Grasela participated at the MEETING in a symposium entitled The challenge of coconut rhinoceros beetle , Oryctes rhinoceros, to palm production and prospects for control in a changing world.

They also participated in a Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle Action Group meeting.
