\begin_layout Abstract
A newly discovered biotype of coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB-G) is rapidly
 killing coconuts and other palms on Guam.
 Following a failed eradication attempt, CRB-G proved hard to control because
 it is resistant to Oryctes nudivirus (OrNV), which was previously used
 as the preferred biological control agent for control of CRB outbreaks
 on Pacific Islands and elsewhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The overall objective of this project is to stop the uncontrolled outbreak
 on Guam.
 Pacific-based entomologists working on this problem agree that the most
 feasible solution is to find a new isolate of OrNV which is highly pathogenic
 to CRB-G.
 Foreign exploration has already discovered an OrNV isolate from an infected
 CRB-G collected in the Philippines.
 If laboratory bioassays indicate that this isolate is pathogenic for CRB-G,
 it will be propogated and distributed throughout Guam by autodissemination.
 All previous OrNV releases on Pacific Islands resulted in immediate and
 sustained suppression of CRB damage to low levels and prevented tree mortality.
 We hope to find an OrNV isolate which will produce similar results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
If the Guam CRB-G infestation cannot be controlled, it is expected that
 most palms on the island will be killed and CRB-G will spread to other
 islands and beyond.
 If CRB-G invades smaller islands and atols where coconut is 
\emph on
the tree of life
\emph default
, a human tragedy will ensue.
 On larger islands, coconut and oil palm industries will be severely impacted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Guam is currently experiencing an uncontrolled and unmonitored CRB-G outbreak
 which was triggered by abundant CRB-G breeding created by a typhoon.
 A positive feedback cycle has begun whereby large numbers of adult beetles
 are killing large numbers of palms which become breeding sites which generate
 even higher numbers of adults.
 Severe damage to Guam's palms prompted the Governor of Guam to declared
 a state of emergency in July 2017.
 Entomologists working on this problem agree that the most feasible solution
 is establishment of biological control using an isolate of OrNV which is
 highly pathogenic to CRB-G

Technical Approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB), 
\emph on
Oryctes rhinoceros
\emph default
, is a major pest of palms.
 Adults bore into crowns to feed on sap.
 A palms maybe killed if CRB feeding activity damages the meristem.
 But this rarely happens at low CRB population densities.
 CRB grubs do no damage.
 They feed on decaying vegetation with standing dead coconuts and fallen
 coconut logs being favored sites.
 In addition, they can feed in many type of organic matter including dead
 trees, green waste, saw dust, manure, compost, and even in bags of commercially
 packaged soil

 10% and 38% of Guam's CRB were infected by this fungus

.
 However, the prefered biocontrol agent for CRB, namely OrNV failed to have
 any effect.
 This lead us to discover that the population of coconut rhinoceros beetles
 (CRB) recently established on Guam is genetically distinct from other populatio
ns of this major palm pest and it is being referred to as the CRB-G biotype

.
 CRB-G is resistant to all available isolates of OrNV, previously the most
 effective biocontrol agent for CRB, and it appears to have other characteristic
s, which make it more invasive and harder to control than other CRB biotypes.
 While there where no range expansions of CRB for a quarter of a century
 (1980 to 2005), CRB is now on the move with the invasion of Guam in 2007,
 the Port Moresby area of Papua New Guinea in 2009, Oahu, Hawaii in 2013,
 and the Honiara area of Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands in 2015.
 It is significant that all of these new invasions involve CRB-G.
 Thus, CRB-G is a regional problem which poses significant risks to Pacific
 island economies and ecosystems.
 Concerned Pacific-based entomologists are attempting to raise support for
 coordinated regional response to CRB-G

Regional Collaboration on CRB-G Management
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moore will continue to work with collaborators at AgResearch New Zealand
 and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) to put together a regional
 collaboration with the objective of finding an effective biocontrol agent
 for CRB-G.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Foreign Exploration for an Effective Biocontrol Agent for CRB-G
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During January, 2017, Moore, Iriarte and Marshall did field work on Negros
 Island, Philippines, were CRB-G coexists with other CRB biotypes.
 The major objective was to find an effective biocontrol agent for CRB-G
 and a secondary objective was to develop and test protocols for further
 foreign exploration.
 DNA analysis of CRB and OrNV from rhino beetle gut samples collected during
 the trip is being done by Dr.
 Sean Marshall in his lab at AgResearch New Zealand.
 Bioassays of any detected OrNV will be done at the University of Guam.
 Further foreign exploration for an effective biocontrol agent for CRB-G
 is contingent on results from this first expedition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Objective 2: Establish Sustainable Biocontrol of CRB-G by Autodissemination
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the OrNV isolate from the infected beetle collected on Negros Island,
 Philippines proves to be pathogenic for Guam beetles in a high dose lab
 bioassay, introduction of the virus into the Guam CRB population via autodissem
ination will commence.
 Otherwise, foreign exploration will continue until a pathogenic isolate
 is found.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the OrNV Negros isolate proves to be pathogenic for CRB-G, in vitro productio
n in insect cell culture will be ramped up at AgResearch lab in New Zealand.
 Autodissemination is a proven method for rapid establishment of OrNV as
 a self sustaining biocontrol agent in CRB populations.
 Healthy CRB adults are dosed with OrNV and released from multiple points.
 Before these beetles get sick, they spread the virus within the healthy
 population during mating and visits to breeding sites.
 On Guam, beetles for autodissemination will be field collected from breeding
 sites and pheromone traps because this is far more efficient than rearing
 beetles in the lab at the current time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Concurrent with autodissemination releases, laboratory bioassays will be
 performed to quantify the toxic (LD50, LT50, etc.) and nontoxic effects
 (fecundity, flight capability, etc.) of OrNV on CRB.
 There will also be an attempt to increase virulence by cycling isolates
 through several generations of beetles.
 Beetles used in bioassays will be field collected and maintained in individual
 Mason jars for at least a month prior to being used to make sure they are
 healthy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Objective 3: Establish a Sustainable Coconut Palm Health Monitoring System
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The CRB-G outbreak on Guam is currently unmonitored on an island-wide basis.
 An island-wide pheromone trapping system, using about 1500 traps, was operated
 by the University of Guam from 2008 to 2014.
 This monitoring system was transferred to the Guam Department of Agriculture
 which abandoned the effort at the end of February, 2016.
 Currently, many coconut palms are being killed by CRB-G.
 But, in the absence of a monitoring system, we do not have an estimate
 of tree mortality or whether or not the damage is increasing or decreasing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clearly, establishment of a monitoring system is necessary if we want to
 evaluate success of the proposed biocontrol project, or any other mitigation
 efforts.
 We intend to establish a semiannual coconut tree health survey rather than
 re-establish pheromone trapping.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Survey Method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Coconut Palm Health Survey will use the following methodology to track
 changes in levels of damage caused by CRB-G.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The survey will monitor at least 1,000 palms located throughout the island.
 An aluminum tag with a unique identifier will be affixed to each palm on
 the initial visit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The free smart phone app, EpiCollect+ will be used to georeference each
 palm, record a digital image, and record damage data.
 (We have successfully used this free app for several localized palm health
 surveys.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The survey will be performed twice per year.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
CRB damage will be recorded in 3 boolean data fields:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Mortality: 1 if palm is dead; 0 otherwise
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
New damage: 1 if any of the 4 youngest fronds have V-shaped cuts; 0 otherwise
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Old damage: 1 if any other fronds have V-shaped cuts; 0 otherwise
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Subsubsection
Digital Image Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We propose to add a methods development component to the survey.
 CRB damage symptoms in the form of V-shaped cuts in fronds are distinctive
 and easy to see in digital images.
 Digital imagery has been used for detection and monitoring of CRB.
 For example, Soloman Sar in Papua New Guinea has developed a Rapid Damage
 Assessment System in which geotagged images of palms are rated for damage
 severity.
 It may be possible to automate detection and monitoring of CRB damage by
 training a computer to detect V-shaped cuts in digital images of coconut
 palms.
 We will test this idea using human classified image libraries as training
 sets.
 If successful, we will program a Raspberry Pi 3 equipped with a camera
 to detect and quantify CRB damage in real time.
 This small, inexpensive CRB damage detector could be mounted on a drone
 or a conventional vehicle for automated detection and monitoring of CRB
 and damage caused by this pest.

Impacts and Benefits
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Foreign exploration leading to discovery of a highly pathogenic strain of
 OrNV or other microbial biocontrol agent for CRB-Guam could lead to implementat
ion of self sustaining population suppression and tolerable damage levels
 on Guam and other islands invaded by CRB-G.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Loss of 50% or more of Guam's palms may be prevented if an effective biocontrol
 agent is found and released quickly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Reduction in CRB population levels on Guam will reduce the risk of accidental
 of the highly invasive CRB-Guam biotype to other Pacifc islands and elsewhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Development of image analysis methods may lead to a small, inexpensive,
 automated CRB damage detector which could be mounted on a drone or a convention
al vehicle.
 This device could be used for early detection or monitoring of CRB damage.
